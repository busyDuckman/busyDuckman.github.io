					<description><![CDATA["Return" (based in latin) [re =back, tornare = to turn]. ie to turn back.
Scopeturn [scope = examine] so: "on closer inspection, you can have it back". Read on for more...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After seeing an item stamped &#8220;return to sender&#8221;, I got thinking.<br />
The word &#8220;return&#8221; is based in latin: <em>re</em> (back) + <em>tornare</em> (to turn). ie to turn back.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I figured I&#8217;d make few other useful phrases, that I could use in my postal affairs, which stemmed from the word &#8216;return&#8217;.</p>
<h1>The List of Alternate &#8220;Returns&#8221;.</h1>
<ul>
<li>abturn [ab = away from]:   &#8220;quick send it anywhere, but here&#8221;</li>
<li>scopeturn [scope = examine]:   &#8220;on closer inspection, you can have it back&#8221;</li>

<li>autoturn [auto = self]:   &#8220;Everything is sent back automatically&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Background</h3>
<p>There is a significant archaeological artefact, the Cascajal Block, that remains an untranslated mystery.</p>
<p>Background:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascajal_Block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascajal_Block</a> and <a href="http://www.famsi.org/mayawriting/cascajal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famsi.org</a></p>
<p>A quite plausible purpose (and most of the translation) of the Cascajal Block jumped out at me straight away. After some work, I formulated an interesting hypothesis that accounts for many things, including the infamous cootie glyph and non standard writing directions.</p>
<p><strong>Upfront:</strong> The skill-set I have in deciphering structured data does not come from linguistics; rather from years of deciphering undocumented file-formats, looking at memory dumps, examining data compression/representation, and reverse engineering data streams.  So, I&#8217;m applying my existing computer science skill set to a different field.  See what you make of my thoughts.</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>I believe the tablet to be a &#8216;trade ledger&#8217;, used in a bartering economy.</p>
<p>I colourised it to explain what I believe is going on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlines show a trade account.</li>
<li>Glyphs shown with coloured lines are people</li>
<li>Colour filled glyphs are businesses.</li>
<li>All other glyphs are trade goods (note they look like food or tools)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cb-translation.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" size-medium wp-image-112 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cb-translation-182x300.jpg" alt="cb translation" width="182" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cb-translation-182x300.jpg 182w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cb-translation.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" /></a></p>
<p>Basic assumption of barter trade. I go in and give a pig, I want a knife in return. The trader says. I wan&#8217;t your pig, but don&#8217;t have a knife. Give me the pig now and I will put a knife aside for you when someone else has one to trade. Let me write this down on the ledger so I don&#8217;t &#8220;forget&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>The trader recorded items he/she owed to people by putting a glyph for that person, followed by the items. (red circles)</li>
<li>When someone owed him something he put the items followed by their names. (green circles)</li>
<li>When he/she had something complex (e.g. a tool/clothing) &#8216;on order&#8217; from a business, he/she put a picture of the business below the items (blue circles).</li>
</ul>
<p>My explanation addresses quite a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the text did not run vertically
<ul>
<li>The accounts ran vertically (causing items to go horizontally, like a spreadsheet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why information appeared &#8220;grouped into areas&#8221;</li>
<li>Why the cootie glyph (purple outline) had not been seen before.
<ul>
<li>It was used to identify a particular person (therefore unique-ish).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why the inscription was so light (it was not meant for a monument).</li>
<li>Why the surface is slightly concave (eg: the block had been rubbed clean and reused often)</li>
<li>why the sequence of symbols were independent of each other (ie. no language structure)</li>
<li>why each cluster of glyphs were were in different sizes.
<ol>
<li>important debts were in &#8216;bold&#8217;</li>
<li>It was not written on the same day</li>
<li>Possibly, different people worked at this trading business.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why my interpretation holds an internal logical consistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name glyphs never appear in the trade section and vice versa</li>
<li>If you look you can see where recording items owed for some people ran out of room and the trader made a new entry.</li>
<li>food like trade items often shown near people</li>
<li>tool like trade items are only shown near businesses</li>
<li>the name glyphs are more intricate than the trade glyphs.</li>
<li>Looking at the stone tablet directly, I also believe a flat stone was rubbed over paid debts to signify the job was done.</li>
</ul>
<p>As this is not my field of research, everything above is pure speculation. I certainly don&#8217;t claim to have &#8216;solved&#8217; anything; I am simply making my speculations public.</p>
