										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I have felt for a while that web searching is still an awkward thing from a Human Computer Interaction point of view. So I made this wish list of simple improvements that would turn my world upside-down.</p>
<h3>10 simple things search engines could do to save my sanity.</h3>
<ol>
<li>NOT display a 10 item &#8220;first page&#8221;, just keep results coming as I scroll down.</li>
<li>Let me filter results by subject. (ie. shopping, info, blog, pop-culture, education, forums)</li>
<li>Display Icons next to the search result that tell me what I am in for:
<ul>
<li>A sound icon if the site auto-plays music / video.</li>
<li>Flash/java/etc icons if the website uses such</li>
<li>Warn me about pop-ups, &#8220;intro banners&#8221; and exit prompts.</li>
<li>NSFW Icon</li>
<li>Does not support my browser/device icon.</li>
<li>Valid security certificate icon.</li>
<li>Something to indicate if most people left the site within 10 seconds of it loading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often the 2 sentences from the page shown below the result is just not enough. Give me a &#8220;more&#8221; link that expands a results preview to a couple of paragraphs.
<ul>
<li>If lots of people expand a particular pages preview, then just automatically do that for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me blacklist a domain from all my future web-searches. (Eg If I don&#8217;t like pintrist, let me remove it from my search results permanently).
<ul>
<li>If a lot of other people have blacklisted a domain, give me a warning icon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be like <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">virustotal.com</a> and let me query how the site fairs against assorted virus checks.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t make me type in the address bar. Ending up at www,paint.net if I search &#8220;paint.net&#8221; is stupid. The whole thing is awkward and reaks of being overly dumbed-down.</li>
<li>Bundle multiple results from the same domain into an expandable result. Eg &#8220;[+] 50 results for rubberducks in ebay.com&#8221;</li>
<li>If the webpage is largely plagiarised&#8230; tell me and provide links to original sites(s) under the link.</li>
<li>If other web pages address the page or website I am about to visit, let me expand a section to see what people are saying.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Web searching still remains very much the same as its was in the mid 90&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The list I have created draws out certain underlying problems that were never addressed.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I follow a result to a new website, I just don&#8217;t know &#8220;what is behind the door&#8221;. I have to click an hope for the best. It&#8217;s 2015 and that this is still a problem seems odd.</li>
<li>I lack control over what comes up in my results. SEO tactics dominate what I see, and my &#8220;intent&#8221; is often ignored.</li>
<li>Websites exist in a context. They reference, each other and elaborate on each others information. We need to encapsulate this.</li>
</ul>
